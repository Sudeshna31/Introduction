ðŸ“ˆWith four years of professional analytics experience and a strong academic background, I possess an excellent foundation in the analytical field. My adeptness in data analysis and visualization is evident, and I possess an in-depth understanding of Python, R, SQL, and Tableau.

ðŸŽ¯My work and studies have been guided by the goal of developing a comprehensive perspective on how technology influences organizational growth.
